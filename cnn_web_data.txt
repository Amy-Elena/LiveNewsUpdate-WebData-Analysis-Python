Speaking at a conference in Beijing held by the\u00a0Russian International Affairs Council and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Qin reiterated Beijing's support for Moscow, saying it plans to work with Russia to oppose the \"use of force and hegemony of individual states,\" TASS said. Qin's remarks come after senior Chinese officials expressed support for Moscow during a meeting with Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko in Beijing on Sunday following the Wagner rebellion, according to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. Some context: China and Russia declared a\u00a0friendship with \u201cno limits\u201d\u00a0in February 2022, shortly before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine. Since then, Beijing has refused to condemn the invasion and instead provided much-needed diplomatic and\u00a0economic support\u00a0for Russia while attempting to portray itself as a peacemaker in the conflict \u2014 a position that has further soured its relations with Western nations.",

            "articleBody": "In the aftermath of Saturday's insurrection by the Wagner Group, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the \"armed rebellion would have been suppressed anyway.\"   Putin's last address to the nation was on Saturday as Wagner chief\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0and his forces launched their march toward Moscow. Putin thanked the Wagner fighters who made the \"right decision\" and halted their advance.\u00a0He said those fighters would have the \"opportunity to continue serving Russia by entering into a contract with the Ministry of Defense or other law enforcement agencies or to return to your family and friends. Whoever wants to can go to Belarus.\" He did not mention Prigozhin by name, but he accused \u201cthe organizers of the rebellion\u201d of \u201cbetraying their country, their people, (and) also betrayed those who were drawn into the crime.\u201d The Wagner march was called off when a supposed deal was struck that would see Prigozhin move to Belarus. Prigozhin remains\u00a0under investigation\u00a0following the rebellion, according to a source at Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. Here are the latest headlines on the rebellion and Russia's war in Ukraine:   Putin meets with top officials after insurrection: Putin held a meeting\u00a0with the heads of security agencies, including Defense Minister Sergei\u00a0Shoigu, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday night, according to state media RIA Novosti. Prigozhin had previously accused Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, of not giving his forces ammunition and was critical of their handling of the conflict in Ukraine. Putin also spoke with UAE President\u00a0Mohamed bin Zayed Al\u00a0Nahyan about\u00a0the rebellion, according to the Kremlin.  \nWagner chief explains his reasoning: Earlier on Monday, Prigozhin broke his silence in an audio message, saying he\u00a0called off the march\u00a0to prevent Russian bloodshed and that the rising was a protest rather than an attempt to topple the government. The Wagner boss said the Russian Defense Ministry had planned for the Wagner private military group to\u00a0\"cease to exist\"\u00a0starting on July 1.\nUS response to \"armed rebellion\": As Russia faced a shocking rebellion, White House officials reached out to foreign and domestic oil producers about the situation unfolding in one of the world\u2019s leading oil powers, a US official told CNN. On Monday, US President Joe Biden said he'd instructed members of his national security team to \"prepare for a range of scenarios\" as the rebellion was underway. Biden emphasized the US and its allies\u00a0had \"nothing to do\"\u00a0with Saturday's events in Russia.\nLukashenko to answer questions: Belarusian state media said President Alexander Lukashenko will answer questions from journalists on Tuesday, according to Russian state media\u00a0RIA Novosti.\u00a0Prigozhin had agreed Saturday to leave Russia for Belarus, the Kremlin said, in a deal apparently brokered by Lukashenko, a close Putin ally.\u00a0The Wagner chief's whereabouts remain unknown.\nUS intel was aware: US intelligence officials were able to gather an extremely detailed and accurate picture of Prigozhin's plans leading up to his short-lived rebellion, including where and how Wagner was planning to advance, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. But the intelligence was so closely held that it was shared only with select allies, including senior British officials, and not at the broader NATO level, sources said.\nRussia's lower parliament says defense forces had total control: The Russian State Duma, or lower parliament, said the defense forces exercised total control during\u00a0Wagner's armed rebellion, according to Russian state media TASS. Andrey Kartapolov, the Duma's head of the Defense Committee, said that \u201cno chaos arose in the Russian defense forces in the background of an attempted armed rebellion, combat control was not interrupted even for a minute.\"\nZelensky claims Ukraine forces have made advances: President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces have made advances on all fronts. The remarks followed his visit to the\u00a0frontlines\u00a0of the\u00a0Donetsk region and Zaporizhzhia on Monday. The Ukraine military said separately that Russia was focusing its efforts on cities in\u00a0the eastern\u00a0Donetsk region.",

The concern was that Ukraine and the West would be seen as helping Prigozhin and threatening Russian sovereignty. \"It's an internal Russian matter,\" the official said the Ukrainian officials were told, echoing what US and other Western officials have said publicly.  \"Ukrainians were being cautioned by allies not to provoke the situation. Make hay of opportunities on Ukrainian territory but don't get drawn into internal matters or strike at offensive military assets inside of Russia,\" the official said. In the war with Russia, Ukraine is suspected of carrying out a growing number of covert cross-border attacks and sabotage on Russian military facilities and even a drone strike on the Kremlin. Ukrainian forces have shelled the Russian Belgorod region, near the border between the countries.",

            "articleBody": "Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's uprising did not come out of nowhere. US officials had been tracking his ongoing growing feud with Russia's Ministry of Defense for months and took note when threats were traded back and forth between them. There were also signs that Wagner was stockpiling weapons and ammunition leading up to the rebellion, CNN has reported. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Gang of Eight, told CNN that Prigozhin's rebellion \"was almost hiding in plain sight.\" Still, it was surprising to US intelligence officials how little resistance Wagner faced. \"The fact that you have a mercenary group, that I don't think had a full 25,000 troops the way Prigozhin claimed, but was able to literally march into Rostov, a city of a million people which was the command and control for the whole Ukrainian war and take it over with barely a shot fired \u2014 that is unprecedented, to say the least,\" Warner said. Multiple sources told CNN that US and Western officials believe that Putin was simply caught off guard by Prigozhin's actions and did not have time to array his forces against the mercenaries before they managed to seize control of the military headquarters in Rostov. Putin also\u00a0likely did not want to divert significant resources away from Ukraine, officials said. Officials do believe, however, that had Prigozhin tried to seize Moscow or the Kremlin, he would have lost \u2014 decisively. That is likely why Prigozhin agreed to strike a deal with Belarus and ultimately turned his troops around, the officials said. Once Prigozhin launched his rebellion, senior US officials began scrambling to connect with allies and partners and reiterate a key message: The West should remain silent and not give Putin any opening to lay the blame on the US or NATO for the insurrection. Privately, US officials were reinforcing to the Russian government that the US had nothing to do with the uprising \u2014 and urging them to maintain the safety and security of their nuclear arsenal, officials said.",

But the intelligence was so closely held that it was shared only with select allies, including senior British officials, and not at the broader NATO level, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. It was not clear exactly when Prigozhin would act, the sources said. But he appears to have decided to move forward with his plan following a June 10 declaration by Russia's Ministry of Defense that all private military companies, including Wagner, would be forced to sign contracts with Russia's military beginning in July and essentially be absorbed by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The intelligence was so secret that within the US, it was briefed only to the most senior administration officials as well as the Gang of Eight members of Congress who have access to the most sensitive intelligence matters. The secrecy surrounding the intelligence was why some senior European officials and even senior officials across the US government were caught off guard by Prigozhin's attack on Friday, and the speed with which Wagner forces marched into Rostov-on-Don and up toward Moscow into Saturday morning, the sources said. Some NATO officials expressed frustration that the intelligence was not shared. But doing so would have risked compromising extremely sensitive sources and methods, sources explained. Ukrainian officials were not told about the intelligence in advance, either, officials said, due primarily to fears that conversations between US and Ukrainian officials might be intercepted by adversaries. Biden spent the days after the rebellion fizzled out speaking with allies, including the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. During those conversations, he shared what information the US had about the rebellion, according to officials, in order to ensure the leaders had a better understanding of what was known to US intelligence.",

            "articleBody": "Seismic shifts\u00a0in Moscow must surely spell similar earthquakes along the\u00a0front lines in Ukraine. But as of Monday, that\u2019s yet to happen. Ukraine\u2019s forces have announced slight changes along the southern front during the weekend and more sustained progress around the largely symbolic city of\u00a0Bakhmut\u00a0\u2014where thousands of Wagner fighters likely died over the winter. On Monday morning, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Mailar said Ukrainian troops had retaken Rivnopil in Donetsk region, which might suggest greater progress in the south. But there has been no Russian collapse, despite that appearing as a major possibility in Moscow during a large part of Saturday, as\u00a0mutinous Wagner forces\u00a0threatened to march on the Russian capital. Disruption to Russia\u2019s presence around Bakhmut is a more likely outcome from the weekend\u2019s turmoil, where some Wagner fighters may retain a presence but where Ukraine has already been advancing. There will undoubtedly have been some changes to Russia\u2019s military positioning as a result of Wagner\u2019s failed insurrection. The group appears to have prepared their rebellion for some time and the units used will hence not have been suddenly withdrawn from the trenches last week. But the Russian military may have panicked at seeing mercenaries advance on Moscow and sent help. A key moment for Moscow's adversaries: This all provides opportunities that Russia\u2019s enemies must seize carefully. Ukraine and its NATO allies will urgently be trying to assess what and where they are, and whether they provide a material advantage to their\u00a0counteroffensive. But this is not something you would seek to rush or get wrong. The sudden application of a bulk of Ukraine\u2019s forces to exploit Russian weaknesses is something Kyiv will doubtless have been patiently waiting for and weighing the merits of for weeks. The weekend\u2019s events have left an indelible mark on the Kremlin\u2019s chances of success in the war. And there are three different ways this can assist Ukraine. Read more.",

            "articleBody": "As Russia faced a shocking rebellion, White House officials reached out to foreign and domestic oil producers about the dangerous situation unfolding in one of the world\u2019s leading oil powers, a US official told CNN on Monday. The conversations with oil producers were described as precautionary in nature.\u00a0They occurred as other American officials were seeking more information about what was really happening inside Russia and attempting to assess the potential consequences, including on the global economy.\u00a0 Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin generated international concern over the weekend by capturing a Russian city and threatening to march all the way to Moscow.\u00a0 On Monday, US President Joe Biden said he'd instructed members of his national security team to \"prepare for a range of scenarios\" as the would-be rebellion was underway. Representatives from the White House, Energy Department and Treasury Department did not comment on the outreach to oil producers.\u00a0 The shocking images raised the specter of a nightmare scenario for the US economy where instability derails Russian oil flows, sending gasoline prices skyrocketing just as inflation has cooled. \u201cRussia matters because it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest net oil exporter. Period,\u201d said Bob McNally, a former senior energy official to President George W. Bush. \u201cRevolutions in major oil countries are a huge deal. I\u2019m sure that focused minds in the White House over the weekend.\u201d Potential impact: Russia exported 7.8 million barrels of oil\u00a0and petroleum products per day in May, according to the International Energy Agency. McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said chaos in Russia could theoretically shut down oil production or block export facilities. He recalled how Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine early last year set off shockwaves in energy markets. \u201cWhen we thought we were going to lose Russia \u2014 just the thought of it \u2014 caused gasoline to go to $5 a gallon,\u201d McNally said.\u00a0 Investors breathed a sigh of relief as Prigozhin\u2019s rebellion proved short-lived, with the Wagner boss turning around his march toward Moscow.\u00a0After\u00a0briefly climbing on the Russia news, US oil prices closed just 0.3% higher on Monday at $69.37 a barrel.\u00a0\u00a0 Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst who now heads global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told clients on Sunday that she understands the White House was \u201cactively engaged\u201d on Saturday in \u201creaching out to key foreign and domestic producers about contingency planning to keep the market well supplied if the crisis impacted Russian output.\u201d Croft said a \"significant concern\" was that Putin would declare martial law and prevent \"workers from showing up to major loading ports and energy facilities\" and therefore potentially halt \"millions of barrels of exports.\"  The former CIA analyst recalled how deep unrest in Libya shut down vast amounts of production in that OPEC nation last decade, sending oil prices surging. \u201cThere was a concurrent concern that critical pipelines could either be directly targeted or inadvertently damaged if the insurrection turned into a full-scale war,\u201d Croft wrote in a note.  McNally said it is standard operating procedure for US energy officials to gather intel during crises like the one that unraveled in Russia. He noted that \"checking with their sources in the industry while the world\u2019s largest exporter is experiencing shocking instability is good business practice.\"",

            "articleBody": "The US is expected to announce another military aid package to Ukraine totaling approximately $500 million, a US official told CNN. The aid, which is expected to be announced on Tuesday, will include additional\u00a0Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, the official said, and will be provided to Ukraine via Presidential Drawdown Authority. Ukraine lost several armored vehicles in the early days of its counteroffensive, which US officials believe Ukrainian forces launched earlier this month. The package comes as US officials continue to assess what impact the Wagner rebellion inside Russia will have on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. US\u00a0and western\u00a0officials told CNN last week that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has not been meeting expectations, with Russian lines of defense proving well-fortified. Russian forces have also had success bogging down Ukrainian armor with missile attacks and mines and have been deploying air power more effectively.\u00a0 The last package, announced earlier this month, was valued at about $325 million and included new air defense and rocket systems for Ukraine.\u00a0 The US has provided more\u00a0than $39 billion\u00a0in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's invasion in February 2022, including $22 billion in presidential drawdowns.",

            "articleBody": "Wagner boss\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0broke his silence in a new audio message Monday \u2014 his first since ending a short-lived rebellion.  Troops from his private military group on Saturday seized control of a military base\u00a0and moved in convoy towards Russia\u2019s capital, a remarkable and unexpected challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The march was suddenly called off when a supposed deal was struck that would see Prigozhin move to Belarus. The leader remains under investigation following the rebellion, according to a source at Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. Here are the latest headlines on the rebellion and Russia's war in Ukraine: Wagner chief explains his reasoning: Prigozhin said in the audio Monday that he called off the demonstration to prevent Russian bloodshed and that the rising was a protest rather than attempt to topple the government. \u201cThe purpose of the march was to prevent the destruction of PMC Wagner and to bring to justice those who, through their unprofessional actions, made a huge number of mistakes during the special military operation,\u201d Prigozhin said the audio message, referring to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  \nPrigozhin claims Russian defense ministry wanted Wagner to \"cease to exist\": The Russian Defense Ministry had planned for the Wagner private military group to \"cease to exist\" starting on July 1, Prigozhin also claimed Monday in the audio message. \"No one agreed to sign a contract with the Defense Ministry, since everyone knows very well from the current situation and their experience during the special military operation that this will lead to a complete loss of combat capability,\"\u00a0Prigozhin said. He then proceeded to say that some fighters did sign contracts with the Ministry of Defense, but claimed that it was only a minimal number.\nRussia is investigating whether Western intelligence was involved in rebellion: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in video comments to Russia Today that the country's special services are investigating whether Western intelligence services were involved in the events which unfolded in Russia Saturday. Russia often alleges foreign interference in domestic ongoings. Lavrov did not immediately present evidence or further information of that alleged investigation. He did claim that the US ambassador to Russia signaled that the US had \"nothing to do\" with the events.\nBiden says US and Western allies \"had nothing to do\" with rebellion: President Joe Biden emphasized Monday that the US and its Western allies had \"nothing to do\" with Saturday's events in Russia. Biden said he directed the national security team to monitor the developments closely and report to him \"hour by hour\" and prepare for a range of scenarios. He said he also spoke to the United States' key allies over the weekend to \"make sure we are all on the same page.\"\nWagner recruitment centers resume work: Wagner Group recruitment centers in the Russian cities of Tyumen and Novosibirsk have resumed recruiting fighters, according to Russian state media on Monday, following temporary closures over the weekend due to the armed Wagner Group rebellion. The Wagner Group center in St. Petersburg also told CNN on Monday that the center \"continues to operate as usual in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.\"\n\u201cTactical success\u201d:\u00a0Ukrainian forces have been engaged in heavy fighting over the past week and have enjoyed\u00a0\u201ctactical success,\u201d\u00a0according to deputy defense minister Hanna Maliar. The Ukrainian army has continued offensive operations near Melitopol and Berdiansk in the south, and around Lyman and Bakhmut in the east, Maliar said. The official also claimed Ukraine has regained control of Rivnopil, a southeastern settlement in the Donetsk region on the Zaporizhzhia border. CNN cannot independently verify this claim. CNN's Mariya Knight, Anna Chernova and Rob Picheta contributed reporting to this post.",

Prigozhin said he wanted to avoid Russian bloodshed and also said the march was a demonstration of protest and not intended to overturn power in the country.\u00a0 This is\u00a0Prigozhin's first audio message since announcing on Saturday night that his column was turning back \"to avoid bloodshed.\" \"Overnight, we have walked 780 kilometers (about 484 miles). Two hundred-something kilometers\u00a0(about 125 miles)\u00a0were left to Moscow,\" Prigozhin claimed in the latest audio message, despite no evidence the Wagner forces made it that close to the Russian capital.\u00a0\u201cNot a single soldier on the ground was killed.\" \u201cWe regret that we were forced to strike on aircraft,\" he said. \"...but these aircraft dropped bombs and launched missile strikes.\" The Wagner boss also claimed in the audio message that about 30 of his fighters died in the Russian military's attack on the mercenary group on Friday.\u00a0Prigozhin said the attack came days before Wagner was due to leave its positions on June 30 to hand over equipment to\u00a0the Southern Military District in Rostov, Russia.\u00a0 The purpose of his forces' march toward Moscow, the Wagner boss said, was to prevent the \"destruction\" of the private military company, and \"to bring to justice those who, through their unprofessional actions, made a huge number of mistakes during the special military operation.\" Prigozhin said the march stopped when the detachment \"made a reconnaissance of the area, and it was obvious that at that moment a lot of blood would be shed. We felt that demonstrating what we were going to do was sufficient.\" \"At this time, Alexander Lukashenko extended his hand and offered to find solutions for the further work of Wagner PMC in legal jurisdiction,\"\u00a0he added.\u00a0 More background: Prigozhin had agreed to leave Russia for Belarus on Saturday following a deal apparently brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko which ended the armed rebellion. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Lukashenko had suggested the deal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to help resolve the brief mutiny, during a telephone conversation on Saturday morning in order to \"avoid the great bloodshed that would inevitably occur if the rebel detachments continued to move toward Moscow. This proposal was supported by President Putin.\"",

Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s challenge to the Russian state erupted and receded in the space of 24 hours, but the consequences of his short-lived mutiny may reverberate for much longer. The brief drama forced a visibly angry President Vladimir Putin to address the nation early on Saturday and threaten Prigozhin with dire consequences, even raising the specter of civil war in the process. The much-prized sense of national purpose in an existential struggle against what Moscow falsely claims are Ukrainian neo-Nazis that were creatures of the West was punctured by what was at times a day of melodrama. Some moments, such as the hasty erection of roadblocks on Moscow\u2019s southern outskirts and the mobilization of Chechen special forces to move on Rostov, were reminiscent of the 1991 attempted coup by Soviet hardliners against Mikhail Gorbachev \u2013 not in a political sense but for the haphazard and inchoate nature of events. This was not lost on Kyiv, with an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, Mikhailo Podolyak, saying that \u201cat the end of the day, everything goes back to normal, (Prigozhin) is not a traitor, he is a hero of Russia, and so on. It\u2019s a failed state.\u201d Russian state media has gone to great lengths to show how Putin was in control throughout. \u201cThe whole night the president has been in touch with all law enforcement structures,\u201d said Pavel Zarubin, a state TV reporter on Sunday.

A deal was apparently struck with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko which would allow Prigozhin to live in Belarus and not face criminal charges in Russia. While a Kremlin spokesperson said criminal charges against Prigozhin have been dropped, state media TASS said that the case against him is still active, citing a source close to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.\nBelarus reception: Prigozhin won\u2019t be welcomed by the Belarusian people if he is exiled to the country, according to Franak Viacorka, a senior adviser to exiled Belarus opposition leader\u00a0Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see [Belarus] as an independent nation, so I think the Belarusian army and Belarusian society will not accept him,\u201d Viacorka told CNN.\nMoscow lifts restrictions: All security restrictions imposed in the Russian capital following the insurrection have ended, Moscow\u2019s mayor said Monday. A CNN team observed Red Square blocked off on Sunday, a day after Prigozhin called off his short-lived mutiny. The mayor thanked Muscovites on Monday for their \u201ccalm and understanding\u201d over the weekend.\nInternal stability: Russia faced a \u201cchallenge\u201d to its internal stability, according to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who acknowledged Prigozhin\u2019s armed mutiny during his address to cabinet ministers on Monday. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also said Monday that the insurrection showed that military power in Russia is \u201ccracking,\u201d and that the instability was \u201caffecting [Russia\u2019s] political system.\u201d\n\"Big\" mistake: This weekend's events demonstrate that Putin made a \u201cbig strategic mistake\u201d by launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. Meanwhile, Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Moscow's invasion of Ukraine was having \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d on Russian leadership.\nShoigu visits Ukraine front line: Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu \u2013 whose removal was one of the explicit aims of Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny \u2013 has reportedly visited Russian troops in Ukraine. According to a statement from the defense ministry, Shoigu traveled to a front line command post of one of the Western group of forces in the special military operation zone. However, neither the ministry nor state media said when the visit took place.\nEU support: European Union member states pledged a further $3.8 billion in support for Ukraine as part of the European Peace Facility, as Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister called on the bloc to \u201caccelerate\u201d Russia\u2019s defeat. The fund has been used by EU nations to finance military aid for Ukraine.\n\u201cTactical success\u201d: Ukrainian forces have been engaged in heavy fighting over the past week and have enjoyed \u201ctactical success,\u201d according to deputy defense minister Hanna Maliar. The Ukrainian army has continued offensive operations near Melitopol and Berdiansk in the south, and around Lyman and Bakhmut in the east, Maliar said.\nKherson hit by heavy shelling: One person was killed and seven others including a pregnant woman were injured after Kherson\u00a0was hit by heavy shelling Monday, a Ukrainian military official said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said Monday they had intercepted 13 air targets overnight, including two Kalibr cruise missiles, seven Shahed attack drones and four unmanned aerial vehicles.",

He vowed to retaliate with force, insinuating that his forces would \u201cdestroy\u201d any resistance, including roadblocks and aircraft.  By Saturday, Prigozhin announced that he was turning his forces around from a march toward Moscow shortly after the Belarusian government claimed President Alexander Lukashenko had reached a deal with him to halt the advance. Prigozhin said the move was in accordance with an unspecified plan and intended to avoid Russian bloodshed. Belarusian officials\u00a0said they cannot confirm if Prigozhin has arrived in the country or what his status will be.",

            "articleBody": "In short: No. Western officials told CNN over the weekend that while they were monitoring the situation and understood the severity of the challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s authority, it did not fundamentally change the objectives of Ukraine\u2019s Western allies. There are, of course, many unanswered questions as to exactly what happened and where it leaves Putin. But for the West \u2013 especially the NATO allies \u2013 the facts and assumptions that drive their Ukraine strategy have not changed. First, Putin is still in power and still has objectives that are unpalatable to the Ukrainian government, which means that they are unpalatable to the Western allies of Ukraine. There is no assumption that a chastened Putin will suddenly become a partner that can be trusted to negotiate peace. There is no sense that Putin\u2019s attitude to the West will soften. There is no belief that even if Putin had a sudden change of heart that he wouldn\u2019t continue to act as a belligerent as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Second, even if the insurrection had led to some kind of change at the top of Russia\u2019s government, the people who toppled Putin would have been equally committed Russian nationalists who have been willing to commit war crimes in this war. At the time of writing, no major Western sources are presenting evidence that Russia\u2019s hectic weekend has presented weaknesses that Ukraine can specifically exploit in its counteroffensive against Russia. Sources specifically highlighted that even if events in Russia do create opportunities, Ukrainian forces will still face deeply-bedded Russian resistance.\u00a0And there is concern that a wounded Putin may strike back even harder. That could all change in the coming hours if such evidence comes to light. But it\u2019s always worth keeping in mind that diplomacy and international relations tend to move at a slower pace than breaking news.",

Some background: Belarus is playing an increasingly prominent role during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with President Alexander Lukashenko providing support to his Russian counterpart. After weeks of speculation, Putin confirmed earlier this month that he has tactical weapons on standby in Belarus \u2014 causing alarm among many in the West. Belarus may also have come to Russia's aid on Saturday during an armed insurrection, apparently brokering a deal with Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.

While acknowledging that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko contributed, the Serbian president said in an interview on Pink television, a private Serbian network, that Putin was the one \"who got it done\" and described the Russian president's actions as \"sharp and decisive.\" Vucic also criticized the Wagner group's actions as \"a stab in the back\" to their own country and said a mistake had been made in Russia giving the group \"enormous power.\" \"They thought they could get away with it. They believed that Putin would not interfere, and [Putin] personally with his statement and his strong stance, stopped it,\"\u00a0Vucic said. \"Putin now has a very difficult task, and that's to raise the motivation of the army, and the confidence of the huge number of disillusioned Wagner soldiers. And none of that will be easy,\" Vucic added. Key context: A major crisis shook the foundations of the Russian state Saturday, as forces loyal to Wagner mercenary boss Prigozhin\u00a0marched toward Moscow. Then, Prigozhin abruptly called off their advance. According to the Belarusian presidential press service, the decision followed an unexpected intervention by Lukashenko. The supposed deal struck with Prigozhin would see the Wagner boss leave for Belarus; a criminal case against the mercenary boss would be dropped; and Wagner fighters would be folded into formal military structures by signing contracts with the Russian ministry of defense. Prigozhin \u2014 whereabouts currently unknown \u2014 has not commented on the supposed agreement.",

The Western stakes in the Ukraine war rose significantly as a result. A mutinous weekend\u00a0that saw mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin flagrantly mock the Kremlin before aborting his march on Moscow evoked Russia\u2019s blood-soaked history of revolutions and coups. Meanwhile,\u00a0efforts by the White House\u00a0and its foreign allies to find out exactly what was happening underlined the volatile nature of a war that could rewrite the map of Europe and modern history. Ultimately, a civil war that seemed about to burst out was averted \u2014 at least for now. The Kremlin strongman seemed to blink at a military confrontation with Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group fighters \u2014 in an act that might preserve his grip on power. But Prigozhin\u2019s defiance \u2014 and the retreat by Putin, who accused him of treason but then agreed to a deal to let him apparently escape to exile in Belarus hours later \u2014 punched the deepest holes in the Russian president\u2019s authority in a generation in power. There\u2019s now no doubt that the war Putin unleashed to wipe Ukraine off the map poses an existential threat to his political survival. The rest of the world must now deal with the implications. Schisms in Moscow and between the government and Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group \u2014 the only Russian fighting force that has enjoyed much recent battlefield success \u2014 might also now conjure an opening for Ukraine, which wants breakthroughs against Moscow\u2019s already demoralized and poorly led troops in its new counteroffensive. This would be good news for the West, which has bankrolled and armed the country\u2019s fight for its life. And there\u2019s no doubt that NATO leaders would love to see Putin gone since there\u2019s no sign he will end the war by pulling his troops out of Ukraine. Read Collinson's full analysis here.",

            "articleBody": "Gains in oil prices evaporated on Monday after a\u00a0brief and chaotic insurrection\u00a0in Russia, with investors questioning whether the turmoil in Moscow could disrupt global energy supplies. US WTI crude briefly climbed 1.3% during Asian trading hours. But it later gave up those gains, last trading flat. Brent crude, the international benchmark, inched up 0.1%, trimming earlier advances. Both futures lost nearly 4% last week. Russia glimpsed the threat of\u00a0armed insurrection\u00a0over the weekend, with Wagner Group mercenaries marching toward Moscow as President Vladimir Putin vowed retribution, before\u00a0a sudden deal\u00a0seemed to defuse the crisis as quickly as it had emerged. Although the immediate risk of bloodshed appears to have dissipated, much remains uncertain. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the insurrection\u00a0shows \u201ccracks\u201d\u00a0in Putin\u2019s role as leader of the country. \u201cThe potential risks to watch may be on any renewed opposition from the Russian public to Putin\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG Group. All eyes on Russia: Signs that global energy demand could weaken this year as economies slow have pushed US crude prices down by nearly 14% so far this year to just under $70 a barrel. (It peaked above $120 a year ago.) The international benchmark, Brent crude, is down by a similar margin. But anything that could jeopardize Russia\u2019s ability to keep supplying global energy markets will be watched anxiously by policymakers in the West and by the country\u2019s biggest customers in Asia.

            "articleBody": "Nearly three years ago, Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0stood by Belarusian President\u00a0Alexander Lukashenko\u00a0in his hour of need, backing Europe\u2019s longest-running dictator as he faced a wave of street protests. Now Lukashenko appears to have come through for Putin, if we are to believe what the Kremlin and the Belarusian presidential press service tell us. A quick recap: A major crisis shook the foundations of the Russian state Saturday, as forces loyal to Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0marched toward Moscow. Then, an abrupt reversal happened \u2014 Prigozhin called off their advance, claiming his mercenaries had come within 124 miles of the capital but were turning around to avoid spilling Russian blood. According to the Belarusian presidential press service, the decision followed an unexpected intervention by Lukashenko himself. The supposed deal struck with Prigozhin would see the Wagner boss leave for Belarus; a criminal case against the mercenary boss would be dropped; and Wagner fighters would be folded into formal military structures by signing contracts with the Russian ministry of defense. But those, it\u2019s worth emphasizing, are only the bare outlines of the deal. Prigozhin \u2014 whereabouts currently unknown \u2014 has not commented on the supposed agreement. And the Kremlin and Belarusian account of Lukashenko\u2019s mediation appear to stretch credibility. Those efforts, Peskov claimed, \u201cmanaged to resolve this situation without further losses, without increasing the level of tension.\u201d Still, Lukashenko\u2019s apparent intercession raises more questions than it answers.

The now-scrapped site for the proposed Russian embassy sits about 400 meters from Australia\u2019s parliamentary precinct in the capital. The Australian government legislated to stop the build earlier this month, saying it was a national security threat. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed the court's decision Monday, saying that unlike Russia's government, Australia would always abide by the rule of law. Some context: Australia has sided with Western allies in support of Kyiv since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began more than a year ago. It has condemned Moscow for its \u201cillegal and immoral\u201d military operations. Russia secured the lease to the land from the Australian government in 2008. Three years later, it was granted approval to build its new embassy there. Last week, Albanese said it was \u201ca different time\u201d since the lease was granted in 2008. \u201cWhat my government\u2019s responsible for is now, and my government has responded,\u201d he said.",

            "articleBody": "Russia's lower house of parliament is\u00a0working on a law to regulate Wagner amid considerable speculation about the mercenary group's future since its chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin,\u00a0launched a rebellion on the weekend. Prigozhin was last seen leaving Rostov-on-Don late on Saturday in a black SUV after the Kremlin said a deal had been brokered by Belarusian President\u00a0Alexander Lukashenko in which\u00a0Prigozhin had agreed to go to Belarus and end his rebellion. Prigozhin himself has not confirmed the deal. Meanwhile, the official Belarus news agency said Sunday that Lukashenko spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin again on Sunday morning. Belarusian officials tell CNN\u00a0they have no details\u00a0on what Prigozhin\u2019s status will be in Belarus and could not confirm whether Prigozhin had already arrived in the country. Here are the latest developments: Red Square barriers:\u00a0A CNN team observed Moscow\u2019s\u00a0Red Square blocked off\u00a0on Sunday, a day after Prigozhin\u00a0called off his\u00a0short-lived insurrection.\u00a0Metal partitions were seen blocking access to the city center and a few security officers were present. Pedestrians were walking on the streets next to the square.\u00a0Red Square was also closed off on Saturday.\nUN urges de-escalation:\u00a0UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Sunday urged all parties involved \u201cto act responsibly and with a view to avoid further tensions\u201d\u00a0in a statement released\u00a0in response to\u00a0recent events in Russia.\n\"Cracks\" in Putin's rule:\u00a0\"First of all, what we've seen is extraordinary. And I think you've seen cracks emerge that weren't there before,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken said, citing in part Prigozhin\u00a0questioning the premise of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\u00a0\nInside the White House:\u00a0US President Joe Biden's primary objective following the Wagner insurrection has been\u00a0denying Putin's pretext for accusing the West of wanting him dead. In a phone call with allies, Biden emphasized the imperative of not lending any credibility to expected claims from Putin of Western interference. Biden also\u00a0reaffirmed the US commitment to Ukraine\u00a0in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the White House said. They discussed the situation in Russia and Zelensky later tweeted: \u201cThe world must put pressure on Russia until international order is restored.\"\nZelensky consults allies:\u00a0The Ukrainian President said he has discussed the weekend\u2019s events in Russia with several world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Polish President Andrzej Duda.\nUS expected \"more bloodshed\":\u00a0As the picture became more clear to US intelligence analysts that\u00a0Prigozhin\u00a0was about to\u00a0mobilize his Wagner troops inside Russia, the expectation was that his march toward Moscow would encounter much more resistance and be\u00a0\u201ca lot more bloody than it was.\u201d\u00a0There was surprise, a US official said, that Russia\u2019s military didn\u2019t do a better job of confronting Wagner troops\u00a0as they moved into Rostov\u00a0and up toward the capital.\nRussian diplomat visits China:\u00a0The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday issued a readout of a\u00a0meeting in Beijing\u00a0between Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Rudenko and China's top diplomats. According to the statement, the discussion also included the upheaval in Russia during the\u00a0Wagner's open mutiny.",

            "articleBody": "Social media video and images have emerged showing the wreckage of a military aircraft reportedly brought down by the Wagner Group in a rural area of southern Russia. The plane\u2019s markings showed that it was a Russian Air Force Ilyushin-22, an aircraft sometimes used as an airborne command and communications center. The Russian Defense Ministry has not commented on the loss of any Il-22 planes. The cause of the crash is not clear, but footage that captured its plunge to Earth indicated it had been struck by a missile or rocket. A Russian military blogger said Saturday that the Wagner forces had shot down an Il-22 aircraft carrying 10 people. Irina Kuksenkova, a correspondent for Russian state-controlled Channel One, said the plane came down near Voronezh, and that Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin had offered to compensate the dead crew\u2019s relatives. Prigozhin has not commented on the crash but claimed Saturday that a Russian combat helicopter was brought down. Video also emerged Sunday of the wreckage of a Ka-52 helicopter in the Talovsky district of the Voronezh region. A Russian military blogger claimed the helicopter had been shot down by Wagner and said the crew had been killed.",

            "articleBody": "Front lines across Ukraine have seen heavy combat over the past two days, with more than 20 engagements occurring in areas in the Donetsk region \u2014\u00a0chiefly Lyman, Marinka and Bakhmut, according to the Ukrainian military. In its operational update, the General Staff said the Russians also carried out 25 airstrikes over the past day. There had been heavy Russian artillery and mortar fire in the Kupyansk area of Kharkiv, where the Russians have been trying to break through for over a month, the Ukrainians said. The General Staff insisted all Russian efforts to take territory had been foiled. Across the Donetsk frontlines, the fighting was characterized by exchanges of indirect fire, but with little movement. However, the Ukrainians say they are on the front foot around Bakhmut. Nearly 200 Russian soldiers had been killed in the past day, and a variety of Russian equipment had been destroyed, according to Cherevatyi. CNN cannot verify Ukrainian claims of battlefield gains, or casualties. In the south, where Ukrainian forces have attempted to break through Russian lines, the General Staff said a Russian effort to regain lost positions in the area of Novodarivka had also failed. Russian artillery continued to strike about 30 settlements along the front lines in the Zaporizhzhia region, it said. In Kherson, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukrainian forces in the south, said the Russians struggled to regain positions on the east bank of the river Dnipro, which was flooded by the recent damage to the dam at Nova Kakhovka.",

            "articleBody": "Desperately projecting that everything is as it was, the Kremlin is only emphasizing how\u00a0much has changed. These were 36 hours\u00a0that provided a glimpse of the end of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule. Almost every action was improbable, at best a week ago \u2014 much was inconceivable, 17 months ago. A loyal henchman, Yevgeny Prigozhin, slams the premise of the invasion of Ukraine, then claims an airstrike targeted his troops, before taking a major military town without clashes,  and then marching to within a few hundred miles of Moscow. But suddenly he executes a baffling reversal, turning back to avoid bloodshed, as the Kremlin claims Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus whom Putin seems to treat with contempt, brokered a dramatic reprieve, in which the insurrectionist who has his armor bound for Moscow, now opts for exile in Minsk. Even as the dust settles, it still makes little sense. It is important to remember we have yet to hear from Prigozhin that he has accepted exile in Belarus and see evidence his units have genuinely all stood down. He is an open proliferator of misinformation. We should be equally suspicious of the apparent bow with which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tried to tie this startling episode up with on Saturday night. Two hours earlier, Wagner's forces were at the gates of the capital (almost), and then suddenly everything is forgiven. There are large parts of this story missing. We may never learn what they are. Many emotions could have altered Prigozhin\u2019s course. Was the advance north too easy? Did he accept entering the capital would leave his men vulnerable, even to a weak Russian military response? Was the regular military not joining him in large enough numbers? Did he believe a climbdown would only grow his support? While on the surface, Prigozhin\u2019s climbdown makes him appear weak, even finished, he has been the decision-maker over the past 36 hours. Putin has been left reacting. Silent initially, and then bombastically angry and confident, promising \u201cinevitable punishment\u201d for the \u201cscum.\u201d But hours later, this was all forgotten. Putin\u2019s emotional state \u2014 were it known \u2014 is arguably less revealing than his actions. By letting Prigozhin go, and apparently sweeping the entire insurrection under the carpet, he\u2019s appeared the weakest yet in 23 years. Read the full analysis here.",
