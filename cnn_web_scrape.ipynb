Putin thanked the Wagner fighters who made the \"right decision\" and halted their advance.\\xa0He said those fighters would have the \"opportunity to continue serving Russia by entering into a contract with the Ministry of Defense or other law enforcement agencies or to return to your family and friends.

US officials had been tracking his ongoing growing feud with Russia\\'s Ministry of Defense for months and took note when threats were traded back and forth between them. There were also signs that Wagner was stockpiling weapons and ammunition leading up to the rebellion, CNN has reported. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Gang of Eight, told CNN that Prigozhin\\'s rebellion \"was almost hiding in plain sight.\" Still, it was surprising to US intelligence officials how little resistance Wagner faced. \"The fact that you have a mercenary group, that I don\\'t think had a full 25,000 troops the way Prigozhin claimed, but was able to literally march into Rostov, a city of a million people which was the command and control for the whole Ukrainian war and take it over with barely a shot fired — that is unprecedented, to say the least,\" Warner said. Multiple sources told CNN that US and Western officials believe that Putin was simply caught off guard by Prigozhin\\'s actions and did not have time to array his forces against the mercenaries before they managed to seize control of the military headquarters in Rostov. Putin also\\xa0likely did not want to divert significant resources away from Ukraine, officials said. Officials do believe, however, that had Prigozhin tried to seize Moscow or the Kremlin, he would have lost — decisively. That is likely why Prigozhin agreed to strike a deal with Belarus and ultimately turned his troops around, the officials said. Once Prigozhin launched his rebellion, senior US officials began scrambling to connect with allies and partners and reiterate a key message: The West should remain silent and not give Putin any opening to lay the blame on the US or NATO for the insurrection. Privately, US officials were reinforcing to the Russian government that the US had nothing to do with the uprising — and urging them to maintain the safety and security of their nuclear arsenal, officials said.', 'image': 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/w_460/d0978fb3-ad45-4cc3-9961-9885ac232543.jpg'}, {'@type': 'BlogPosting', 'headline': \"US gathered detailed intelligence on Wagner chief's rebellion plans but kept it secret, sources say\", 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_2db9e18683d7bf1af80f96c32e20d585', 'dateModified': '2023-06-26T22:16:43.940Z', 'datePublished': '2023-06-26T22:16:43.940Z', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_2db9e18683d7bf1af80f96c32e20d585'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ' https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/02/20/cnn-publisher-img.png', 'width': 103, 'height': 60}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kathleen Magramo, Christian Edwards, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Maureen Chowdhury and Amir Vera, CNN'}, 'articleBody': \"US intelligence officials were able to gather an extremely detailed and accurate picture of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's plans leading up to his short-lived rebellion, including where and how Wagner was planning to advance, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. But the intelligence was so closely held that it was shared only with select allies, including senior British officials, and not at the broader NATO level, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. It was not clear exactly when Prigozhin would act, the sources said. But he appears to have decided to move forward with his plan following a June 10 declaration by Russia's Ministry of Defense that all private military companies, including Wagner, would be forced to sign contracts with Russia's military beginning in July and essentially be absorbed by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The intelligence was so secret that within the US, it was briefed only to the most senior administration officials as well as the Gang of Eight members of Congress who have access to the most sensitive intelligence matters. The secrecy surrounding the intelligence was why some senior European officials and even senior officials across the US government were caught off guard by Prigozhin's attack on Friday, and the speed with which Wagner forces marched into Rostov-on-Don and up toward Moscow into Saturday morning, the sources said. Some NATO officials expressed frustration that the intelligence was not shared. But doing so would have risked compromising extremely sensitive sources and methods, sources explained. Ukrainian officials were not told about the intelligence in advance, either, officials said, due primarily to fears that conversations between US and Ukrainian officials might be intercepted by adversaries. Biden spent the days after the rebellion fizzled out speaking with allies, including the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. During those conversations, he shared what information the US had about the rebellion, according to officials, in order to ensure the leaders had a better understanding of what was known to US intelligence.\", 'image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230625112553-prigozhin-putin-split-super-tease.jpg'}, {'@type': 'BlogPosting', 'headline': \"Analysis: Here's how Ukraine will seek to take advantage following rebellion in Russia\", 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_fd0789c9dccdc590c75d113af005c176', 'dateModified': '2023-06-26T22:17:09.120Z', 'datePublished': '2023-06-26T22:12:51.883Z', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_fd0789c9dccdc590c75d113af005c176'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ' https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/02/20/cnn-publisher-img.png', 'width': 103, 'height': 60}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kathleen Magramo, Christian Edwards, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Maureen Chowdhury and Amir Vera, CNN'}, 'articleBody': \"Seismic shifts\\xa0in Moscow must surely spell similar earthquakes along the\\xa0front lines in Ukraine. But as of Monday, that’s yet to happen. Ukraine’s forces have announced slight changes along the southern front during the weekend and more sustained progress around the largely symbolic city of\\xa0Bakhmut\\xa0—where thousands of Wagner fighters likely died over the winter. On Monday morning, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Mailar said Ukrainian troops had retaken Rivnopil in Donetsk region, which might suggest greater progress in the south. But there has been no Russian collapse, despite that appearing as a major possibility in Moscow during a large part of Saturday, as\\xa0mutinous Wagner forces\\xa0threatened to march on the Russian capital. Disruption to Russia’s presence around Bakhmut is a more likely outcome from the weekend’s turmoil, where some Wagner fighters may retain a presence but where Ukraine has already been advancing. There will undoubtedly have been some changes to Russia’s military positioning as a result of Wagner’s failed insurrection. The group appears to have prepared their rebellion for some time and the units used will hence not have been suddenly withdrawn from the trenches last week. But the Russian military may have panicked at seeing mercenaries advance on Moscow and sent help. A key moment for Moscow's adversaries: This all provides opportunities that Russia’s enemies must seize carefully. Ukraine and its NATO allies will urgently be trying to assess what and where they are, and whether they provide a material advantage to their\\xa0counteroffensive. But this is not something you would seek to rush or get wrong. The sudden application of a bulk of Ukraine’s forces to exploit Russian weaknesses is something Kyiv will doubtless have been patiently waiting for and weighing the merits of for weeks. The weekend’s events have left an indelible mark on the Kremlin’s chances of success in the war. And there are three different ways this can assist Ukraine.

The conversations with oil producers were described as precautionary in nature.\\xa0They occurred as other American officials were seeking more information about what was really happening inside Russia and attempting to assess the potential consequences, including on the global economy.\\xa0 Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin generated international concern over the weekend by capturing a Russian city and threatening to march all the way to Moscow.\\xa0 On Monday, US President Joe Biden said he\\'d instructed members of his national security team to \"prepare for a range of scenarios\" as the would-be rebellion was underway. Representatives from the White House, Energy Department and Treasury Department did not comment on the outreach to oil producers.\\xa0 The shocking images raised the specter of a nightmare scenario for the US economy where instability derails Russian oil flows, sending gasoline prices skyrocketing just as inflation has cooled. “Russia matters because it’s the world’s largest net oil exporter. Period,” said Bob McNally, a former senior energy official to President George W. Bush. “Revolutions in major oil countries are a huge deal. I’m sure that focused minds in the White House over the weekend.” Potential impact: Russia exported 7.8 million barrels of oil\\xa0and petroleum products per day in May, according to the International Energy Agency. McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said chaos in Russia could theoretically shut down oil production or block export facilities. He recalled how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early last year set off shockwaves in energy markets. “When we thought we were going to lose Russia — just the thought of it — caused gasoline to go to $5 a gallon,” McNally said.\\xa0 Investors breathed a sigh of relief as Prigozhin’s rebellion proved short-lived, with the Wagner boss turning around his march toward Moscow.\\xa0After\\xa0briefly climbing on the Russia news, US oil prices closed just 0.3% higher on Monday at $69.37 a barrel.\\xa0\\xa0 Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst who now heads global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told clients on Sunday that she understands the White House was “actively engaged” on Saturday in “reaching out to key foreign and domestic producers about contingency planning to keep the market well supplied if the crisis impacted Russian output.” Croft said a \"significant concern\" was that Putin would declare martial law and prevent \"workers from showing up to major loading ports and energy facilities\" and therefore potentially halt \"millions of barrels of exports.\"  The former CIA analyst recalled how deep unrest in Libya shut down vast amounts of production in that OPEC nation last decade, sending oil prices surging. “There was a concurrent concern that critical pipelines could either be directly targeted or inadvertently damaged if the insurrection turned into a full-scale war,” Croft wrote in a note.  McNally said it is standard operating procedure for US energy officials to gather intel during crises like the one that unraveled in Russia. He noted that \"checking with their sources in the industry while the world’s largest exporter is experiencing shocking instability is good business practice.\"', 'image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230625112553-prigozhin-putin-split-super-tease.jpg'}, {'@type': 'BlogPosting', 'headline': 'Russia continues to focus \"main efforts\" on cities in eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine says', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_e1808ae45d88a8516e408ba4e1d6ec65', 'dateModified': '2023-06-26T19:14:44.695Z', 'datePublished': '2023-06-26T19:04:38.445Z', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_e1808ae45d88a8516e408ba4e1d6ec65'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ' https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/02/20/cnn-publisher-img.png', 'width': 103, 'height': 60}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kathleen Magramo, Christian Edwards, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Maureen Chowdhury and Amir Vera, CNN'}, 'articleBody': 'Russia continues to focus its \"main efforts\" on cities in\\xa0the eastern\\xa0Donetsk region, Ukraine\\'s Armed Forces said on Monday evening.

Yevgeny Prigozhin’s challenge to the Russian state erupted and receded in the space of 24 hours, but the consequences of his short-lived mutiny may reverberate for much longer. The brief drama forced a visibly angry President Vladimir Putin to address the nation early on Saturday and threaten Prigozhin with dire consequences, even raising the specter of civil war in the process. The much-prized sense of national purpose in an existential struggle against what Moscow falsely claims are Ukrainian neo-Nazis that were creatures of the West was punctured by what was at times a day of melodrama. Some moments, such as the hasty erection of roadblocks on Moscow’s southern outskirts and the mobilization of Chechen special forces to move on Rostov, were reminiscent of the 1991 attempted coup by Soviet hardliners against Mikhail Gorbachev – not in a political sense but for the haphazard and inchoate nature of events. This was not lost on Kyiv, with an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Mikhailo Podolyak, saying that “at the end of the day, everything goes back to normal, (Prigozhin) is not a traitor, he is a hero of Russia, and so on. It’s a failed state.” Russian state media has gone to great lengths to show how Putin was in control throughout. “The whole night the president has been in touch with all law enforcement structures,” said Pavel Zarubin, a state TV reporter on Sunday.

Here are the latest developments: Mutiny: Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was last seen Saturday evening leaving Rostov-on-Don after calling off the attempted insurrection. A deal was apparently struck with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko which would allow Prigozhin to live in Belarus and not face criminal charges in Russia. While a Kremlin spokesperson said criminal charges against Prigozhin have been dropped, state media TASS said that the case against him is still active, citing a source close to the Prosecutor General’s Office.\\nBelarus reception: Prigozhin won’t be welcomed by the Belarusian people if he is exiled to the country, according to Franak Viacorka, a senior adviser to exiled Belarus opposition leader\\xa0Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. “He doesn’t see [Belarus] as an independent nation, so I think the Belarusian army and Belarusian society will not accept him,” Viacorka told CNN.\\nMoscow lifts restrictions: All security restrictions imposed in the Russian capital following the insurrection have ended, Moscow’s mayor said Monday. A CNN team observed Red Square blocked off on Sunday, a day after Prigozhin called off his short-lived mutiny. The mayor thanked Muscovites on Monday for their “calm and understanding” over the weekend.\\nInternal stability: Russia faced a “challenge” to its internal stability, according to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who acknowledged Prigozhin’s armed mutiny during his address to cabinet ministers on Monday. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also said Monday that the insurrection showed that military power in Russia is “cracking,” and that the instability was “affecting [Russia’s] political system.”\\n\"Big\" mistake: This weekend\\'s events demonstrate that Putin made a “big strategic mistake” by launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. Meanwhile, Germany\\'s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Moscow\\'s invasion of Ukraine was having “devastating consequences” on Russian leadership.\\nShoigu visits Ukraine front line: Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu – whose removal was one of the explicit aims of Prigozhin’s mutiny – has reportedly visited Russian troops in Ukraine. According to a statement from the defense ministry, Shoigu traveled to a front line command post of one of the Western group of forces in the special military operation zone. However, neither the ministry nor state media said when the visit took place.\\nEU support: European Union member states pledged a further $3.8 billion in support for Ukraine as part of the European Peace Facility, as Ukraine’s foreign minister called on the bloc to “accelerate” Russia’s defeat. The fund has been used by EU nations to finance military aid for Ukraine.\\n“Tactical success”: Ukrainian forces have been engaged in heavy fighting over the past week and have enjoyed “tactical success,” according to deputy defense minister Hanna Maliar. The Ukrainian army has continued offensive operations near Melitopol and Berdiansk in the south, and around Lyman and Bakhmut in the east, Maliar said.\\nKherson hit by heavy shelling: One person was killed and seven others including a pregnant woman were injured after Kherson\\xa0was hit by heavy shelling Monday, a Ukrainian military official said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said Monday they had intercepted 13 air targets overnight, including two Kalibr cruise missiles, seven Shahed attack drones and four unmanned aerial vehicles.', 'image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230625112553-prigozhin-putin-split-super-tease.jpg'}, {'@type': 'BlogPosting', 'headline': 'Wagner developments show \"weakness\" of Russian regime, NATO chief says', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_9cfe29f2594fd112eeeea2d25d544045', 'dateModified': '2023-06-26T13:12:33.424Z', 'datePublished': '2023-06-26T13:09:08.165Z', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-26-23/h_9cfe29f2594fd112eeeea2d25d544045'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ' https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/02/20/cnn-publisher-img.png', 'width': 103, 'height': 60}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kathleen Magramo, Christian Edwards, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes, Maureen Chowdhury and Amir Vera, CNN'}, 'articleBody': 'The developments in Russia over the weekend show the \"weakness\" and \"fragility\" of the Russian regime,\\xa0NATO\\xa0Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\\xa0said Monday.\\xa0 Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin\\'s armed insurrection \"demonstrated how difficult and dangerous it is for President [Vladimir] Putin to be relying on mercenaries that have actually turned against him,\" Stoltenberg said.\\xa0 Stoltenberg went on to say that it is unclear what will happen in Russia over the next days and weeks.

There are, of course, many unanswered questions as to exactly what happened and where it leaves Putin. But for the West – especially the NATO allies – the facts and assumptions that drive their Ukraine strategy have not changed. First, Putin is still in power and still has objectives that are unpalatable to the Ukrainian government, which means that they are unpalatable to the Western allies of Ukraine. There is no assumption that a chastened Putin will suddenly become a partner that can be trusted to negotiate peace. There is no sense that Putin’s attitude to the West will soften. There is no belief that even if Putin had a sudden change of heart that he wouldn’t continue to act as a belligerent as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Second, even if the insurrection had led to some kind of change at the top of Russia’s government, the people who toppled Putin would have been equally committed Russian nationalists who have been willing to commit war crimes in this war. At the time of writing, no major Western sources are presenting evidence that Russia’s hectic weekend has presented weaknesses that Ukraine can specifically exploit in its counteroffensive against Russia. Sources specifically highlighted that even if events in Russia do create opportunities, Ukrainian forces will still face deeply-bedded Russian resistance.\\xa0And there is concern that a wounded Putin may strike back even harder. That could all change in the coming hours if such evidence comes to light.

The Western stakes in the Ukraine war rose significantly as a result. A mutinous weekend\\xa0that saw mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin flagrantly mock the Kremlin before aborting his march on Moscow evoked Russia’s blood-soaked history of revolutions and coups. Meanwhile,\\xa0efforts by the White House\\xa0and its foreign allies to find out exactly what was happening underlined the volatile nature of a war that could rewrite the map of Europe and modern history. Ultimately, a civil war that seemed about to burst out was averted — at least for now. The Kremlin strongman seemed to blink at a military confrontation with Prigozhin’s Wagner Group fighters — in an act that might preserve his grip on power. But Prigozhin’s defiance — and the retreat by Putin, who accused him of treason but then agreed to a deal to let him apparently escape to exile in Belarus hours later — punched the deepest holes in the Russian president’s authority in a generation in power. There’s now no doubt that the war Putin unleashed to wipe Ukraine off the map poses an existential threat to his political survival. The rest of the world must now deal with the implications. Schisms in Moscow and between the government and Prigozhin’s Wagner Group — the only Russian fighting force that has enjoyed much recent battlefield success — might also now conjure an opening for Ukraine, which wants breakthroughs against Moscow’s already demoralized and poorly led troops in its new counteroffensive.

Then, an abrupt reversal happened — Prigozhin called off their advance, claiming his mercenaries had come within 124 miles of the capital but were turning around to avoid spilling Russian blood. According to the Belarusian presidential press service, the decision followed an unexpected intervention by Lukashenko himself. The supposed deal struck with Prigozhin would see the Wagner boss leave for Belarus; a criminal case against the mercenary boss would be dropped; and Wagner fighters would be folded into formal military structures by signing contracts with the Russian ministry of defense. But those, it’s worth emphasizing, are only the bare outlines of the deal. Prigozhin — whereabouts currently unknown — has not commented on the supposed agreement. And the Kremlin and Belarusian account of Lukashenko’s mediation appear to stretch credibility. Those efforts, Peskov claimed, “managed to resolve this situation without further losses, without increasing the level of tension.” Still, Lukashenko’s apparent intercession raises more questions than it answers.

These were 36 hours\\xa0that provided a glimpse of the end of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule. Almost every action was improbable, at best a week ago — much was inconceivable, 17 months ago. A loyal henchman, Yevgeny Prigozhin, slams the premise of the invasion of Ukraine, then claims an airstrike targeted his troops, before taking a major military town without clashes,  and then marching to within a few hundred miles of Moscow. But suddenly he executes a baffling reversal, turning back to avoid bloodshed, as the Kremlin claims Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus whom Putin seems to treat with contempt, brokered a dramatic reprieve, in which the insurrectionist who has his armor bound for Moscow, now opts for exile in Minsk. Even as the dust settles, it still makes little sense. It is important to remember we have yet to hear from Prigozhin that he has accepted exile in Belarus and see evidence his units have genuinely all stood down. He is an open proliferator of misinformation. We should be equally suspicious of the apparent bow with which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tried to tie this startling episode up with on Saturday night. Two hours earlier, Wagner's forces were at the gates of the capital (almost), and then suddenly everything is forgiven. There are large parts of this story missing. We may never learn what they are. Many emotions could have altered Prigozhin’s course. Was the advance north too easy? Did he accept entering the capital would leave his men vulnerable, even to a weak Russian military response? Was the regular military not joining him in large enough numbers? Did he believe a climbdown would only grow his support?
